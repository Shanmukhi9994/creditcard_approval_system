## Project Structure

- api/ - Django app containing models, views, and serializers
- Dockerfile - Docker image setup
- docker-compose.yml - Docker Compose configuration
- customer_data.xlsx & loan_data.xlsx - Sample data files for data ingestion
- manage.py - Django management script

---

## Notes

- Ensure that the Excel files are mounted inside the container at /code/ for the fill-data endpoint to work.
- The system uses a custom primary key customer_id for Customer model; queries should use this field.
- EMI calculations and credit score logic are essential for loan approval decisions.
